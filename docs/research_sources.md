## Key Insights and Decisions

### 1. YOLO11 > YOLO12
Despite YOLO12 being newer (2025), YOLO11 (2024) is faster and equally accurate. YOLO12's attention-centric architecture adds complexity without significant performance gains.

### 2. TensorRT is Essential
Without TensorRT optimization, real-time performance at 4K stereo is unlikely. TensorRT provides 2-3x speedup with minimal accuracy loss.

### 3. Dual CUDA Streams Critical
Processing left and right eye streams in parallel is essential for meeting 30-60 FPS targets. Sequential processing would halve throughput.

### 4. CPU Threads Underutilized
128 threads is overkill for video processing. We allocate 80 threads (62.5%) for async pipeline, leaving ample reserve for system operations.

### 5. VRAM Budget is Tight but Manageable
24GB VRAM is sufficient for dual-stream YOLO11 processing with batch size 4, but requires careful memory management for 8K.

### 6. Temporal Consistency is Secondary
For VR video processing, accuracy and speed are more critical than perfect temporal consistency. Post-processing smoothing is sufficient.

### 7. SAM2.1 is Complementary, Not Primary
SAM2.1 provides better quality but is slower. Use for key frames or quality control, not primary real-time processing.

---

## Confidence Assessment

### High Confidence (>90%)
- YOLO11-Seg is best choice for primary model
- TensorRT optimization will achieve 2-3x speedup
- RTX 3090 can handle 4K stereoscopic at 30-60 FPS
- Technology stack is compatible and well-supported
- Dual CUDA streams will work for parallel processing

### Medium Confidence (70-90%)
- Exact FPS numbers (will vary with implementation)
- 8K processing will achieve 8-15 FPS (may need optimization)
- 128 CPU threads will be effectively utilized
- Temporal consistency will be sufficient with smoothing
- 16-week timeline is realistic (depends on team)

### Lower Confidence (50-70%)
- RF-DETR Seg integration complexity
- SAM2.1 integration effort
- Edge cases and error handling complexity
- Long-term thermal stability under sustained load

---

## Research Gaps and Limitations

### What We Don't Know
1. **Exact FPS on RTX 3090:** Most benchmarks use A100, T4, or 2080Ti

4. **Thermal throttling:** No data on sustained performance over hours
5. **Specific CUDA 12.4 performance:** Many benchmarks use CUDA 11.x

### Assumptions Made
1. Linear scaling from published benchmarks to RTX 3090
2. Negligible overhead from stereoscopic synchronization
3. Preprocessing/postprocessing won't dominate pipeline
4. FFmpeg NVENC/NVDEC will work as expected
5. No major compatibility issues with CUDA 12.4

### Recommended Validation
1. **Benchmark RTX 3090:** Test actual hardware with YOLO11-Seg
2. **Profile pipeline:** Identify real bottlenecks
3. **Thermal testing:** Extended runs to check throttling
4. **Memory profiling:** Validate VRAM usage estimates
5. **Quality assessment:** Measure temporal consistency

### 5. YOLOv8 Instead of YOLO11
**Rejected:** YOLO11 is newer and better

### 6. YOLO12 Instead of YOLO11
